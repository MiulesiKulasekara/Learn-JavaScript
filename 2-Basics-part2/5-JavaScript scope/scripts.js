// Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. In JavaScript there are two types of scope.
//     1. Local
//     2. Global

// --Local Variables--
// Variables declared within a JavaScript function, They can only be accessed from within the function. Local variables are deleted when the function is completed.


// --Global Variables--
// A variable declared outside a function, All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab)
