    <h2>Tip Calculator</h2>

    <p>Dasun and his freinds went on a picnic. To get food they went to 3 different restaurants for each meal. The bills are Rs. 1230, Rs. 982, Rs. 1640.
        To tip the waiter a fair amount, Dasun created a simple tip calculator (as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is grater than Rs. 1500, 15% when the bill is between Rs. 1000 and Rs. 1500, and 10% if the bill is less than Rs. 1000.
        In the end, Dasun would like to have 2 arrays:<br>
        1. Containing all 3 tips<br>
        2. Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip)</p>
